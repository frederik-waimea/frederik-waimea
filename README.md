## Hi there 👋
I'm Frederik and I'm a little person at Waimea College.
I'm fluent in two languages: German, English.
Currently I'm just working on getting back into Kotlin and school and stuff afer the long summer break.

## I really like:
-analysing problems
-doing stuff outside like hiking, kayaking and all those things
-reading
-listenting to audio books
